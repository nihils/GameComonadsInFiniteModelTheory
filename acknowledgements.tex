First, I would like to thank by dissertation supervisor, Samson Abramsky, for his weekly guidance throughout this project. I am also grateful for my course supervisor, Jamie Vicary, for his encouragement throughout the MFoCS program. 

I am thankful for the illuminating insights I got from the semi-weekly sheaf lunches with members of the Quantum Group in Oxford Computer Science. In particular, I would like to thank Kohei Kishida and Rui Soares Barbosa for a discussion that helped to structure my thoughts on this dissertation. 

I would also like to thank Ehud Hrushovski for his lectures on model theory; as well as my teachers at UC Berkeley; especially Paolo Mancosu, Thomas Scanlon, Adam Topaz, James Freitag, Wesley Holliday and Theodore Slaman for giving me a solid grounding in mathematical logic, category theory and philosophy of mathematics. 

Lastly, I would like thank my parents and sister for their support and love throughout my education.
