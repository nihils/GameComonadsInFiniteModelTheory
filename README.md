# GameComandsInFiniteModelTheory
These are latex files for my dissertation on "Game Comonads in Finite Model Theory". 
This dissertation is for completion of my MSc. in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science Dissertation from University of Oxford. 
Completed in Sept. 2017

Edit 2020-06-10: It has come to my attention that the back-and-forth equivalence characterizations for the EF-comonad and modal comonad are incorrect as stated in this dissertation. To see a modified definition for back-and-forth equivalence that does work, in terms of the comonads, please consult this paper:
